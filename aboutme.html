									<h1>Who is Anna-Marjorie?</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Professionally a Full-Stack Web Developer, dedicated to always be learning more about what's new in Coding and Business Development in order to make the most impact I can. Jersey girl, born and bred. Here is where I developed my grit. I grew up in a family of Entrepreneurs, always striving for the best. I attended an intense 6 month Software Engineering Program through Columbia University Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences where I learned a multidude of skills covering Front End, Back End and Computer Science skills. I have always been interested in Software Engineering because the power that is behind this skill is immense and can change the way the world works, it already has.</p>
								<p>Personally, I am an ambitious person, always looking to learn. I love meeting new people and broadening my horizons. I have been playing beach volleyball every summer for most of my life, and enjoy being active which is why I moved to sunny Tampa, Fl in 2020.</p>
